 *
 * 1-----------------------------------------------------
 *  How do I enable Webstorm to autodetect errors instead of letting it do something and skipping what is not there
 *      for example
 *          when we do for a header:
 *              document.getElementByName('h1')[0]
 *              this don't do anything; Doens't even tell that the error is the fact that it should be
 *              document.getElementByTagName('h1')[0] instead
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * 2----------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  It doens't tell me when i type something wrong
 *      for example
 *          <h1 alight="centered" ...>...</h1>
 *          in this case "centered" is not defined but it doens't detect it.
